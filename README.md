This is an introduction to Jest and Enzyme.

I created some test to start learning these JavaScript testing utilities. 
I have following this course https://www.udemy.com/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/ 
and also the original documentation 
of Enzyme https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme and Jest https://jestjs.io/ 

If you want to focus on what is important are only these to files
App.js
App.test.js
